### Introduction
Although OpenRocket is an excellent instructional tool, it does not by itself teach basic rocketry principles.  To use it effectively, the user should have some basic knowledge about how rockets work.  Here is a list of resources to help jumpstart those who are new to rocketry.

This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but should be good enough to get just about anyone started on their rocketry journey.

### All About Amateur Rocketry

* G. Harry Stine's "Handbook of Model Rocketry", now in its 7th edition, is considered by most to be the definitive guide to rocketry, by the man who pretty much invented the hobby.  It teaches general rocketry principles along with just about everything about model rocket design, construction, and launching.  [[Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Model-Rocketry-7th-Official/dp/0471472425/)

* Mike Westerfield has written two highly-regarded general rocketry books: "Make: Rockets: Down-to-Earth Rocket Science" is another general rocketry reference, while "Make: High-Power Rockets: Construction and Certification for Thousands of Feed and Beyond" focuses specifically on the high-powered end of the hobby. [[Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Model-Rocketry-Handbook-21st-Century/dp/1854862294/)

### Rocket Aerodynamics and Stability

* OpenRocket's Center of Pressure calculations are based on the work of James and Judith Barrowman, whose seminal paper can be found on the Apogee Rockets website. [[link]](https://www.apogeerockets.com/downloads/barrowman_report.pdf).

* Estes published an excellent tech note discussing aerodynamic drag back in 1970. [[link]](/resources/estes_drag.pdf)

### About OpenRocket

* If you'd like to know about how OpenRocket itself works, then the best place to start is with Sampo Niskanen's original master's thesis [[link]](http://openrocket.sourceforge.net/thesis.pdf)

* Head on over to Github if you want to dive into the OR code [[link]](https://github.com/openrocket/openrocket)

### Online Resources

* The Rocketry Forum (TRF) hosts discussions of just about every aspect of amateur rocketry (discussions of propellant formulations are restricted to those with L2 certification.) TRF is also an "official" place to go for help with OpenRocket. [[link]](https://www.rocketryforum.com/)

* Ye Olde Rocket Forum (YORF) leans more towards low- and mid-power rocketry, and is a wonderful resource for learning about the history of the hobby. [[link]](https://oldrocketforum.com)

* The OpenRocket Discord server is specifically for discussion of OpenRocket itself, including user questions, bug reports, and discussions about the ongoing development of the app. [[link]](https://discord.gg/Mrb3dU5raZ)

* The /r/rocketry Discord is another lively discussion forum where all aspects of rocketry are discussed. [[link]](https://discord.com/invite/Ezgs4TGXvx)

* The OpenRocket wiki has all sorts of documentation about OpenRocket, and it's own [resource page](https://wiki.openrocket.info/Resources) with a whole lot more technical references for those who want to do a deeper dive. [[link]](https://wiki.openrocket.info)

* The National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA) web pages are host to a ton of information about the hobby of amateur rocketry. [[NAR]](https://nar.org/) [[TRA]](https://tripoli.org)

* The Apogee Rockets website is unique among vendors in terms of the enormous amount of educational materials it provides. [[link]](https://www.apogeerockets.com/)
