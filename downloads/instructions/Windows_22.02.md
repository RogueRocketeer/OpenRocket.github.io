### Downloading the 22.02 Release

Download the Windows installer above for the <font color="red"><i>NEW</i></font> OpenRocket beta release, saying yes to whatever security prompts your browser presents. Then, double-click on or open the file to run the installer, much like other Windows installers.

Although the Windows installer download file has signed with a Microsoft signing certificate for Java, it may take some time before Microsift recognizes the use of that certificate when downloading OpenRocket. Because of this, when downloading the OpenRocket installer, you may see cautionary prompts that require a response that may not be completely clear as to what needs to be done. Following is an example of these prompts when downloading the OpenRocket installer using the Microsoft Edge browser:
<html>
  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02/2022-02.01.01.Download.Cannot_Scan.png" alt="Download Security Warning" width="340">
      </td>
      <td>
        When you begin downloading the installer, this prompt may appear.  If you wish to continue with the download, <strong>left-click on "DOWNLOAD ANYWAY" to start the installer download</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02/2022-02.01.02.Download.Save_As.png" alt="Save as" width="300">
      </td>
      <td>Left-click "Save as", then select the folder where the download will be saved and left-click "Save".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02/2022-02.01.04.Download.More_Actions.png" alt="Trust Warning 2" width="300">	
      </td>
      <td>
        This prompt may then appear.To continue, <strong>move your cursor to the warning</strong> and three dots will appear.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02/2022-02.01.05.Download.Keep.png" alt="Trust Warning 3" width="300">
      </td>
      <td>
        If you wish to finish the download, <strong>open the additional options by left-clicking on the three dots</strong>. Then, <strong>left-click on "Keep" to save the OpenRocket installer</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>

      </td>
      <td>
        Then, <em>Windows</em> wants you to be sure that you really want to keep the downloaded file. So, if you wish to keep the OpenRocket installer, then <strong>left-click the "Show more" option</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02/2022-02.01.07.Download.Keep_Anyway.png" alt="Trust Warning 5" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
        When you do so, this prompt should appear. If you wish to finish saving the downloaded file, then <strong>left-click on "Keep anyway" to complete the process of saving the OpenRocket installer</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02/2022-02.01.08.Download.Open_File.png" alt="Trust Warning 6" width="300">
