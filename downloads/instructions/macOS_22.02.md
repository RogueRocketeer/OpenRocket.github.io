### Downloading the 22.02 Release
Download the macOS installer above, saying yes to whatever security prompts your browser presents. Once the installer file is downloaded, follow the instructions below to install the OpenRocket application.

<b style="color: red">Important note</b>: If you have an **Apple Silicon** processor in your Apple computer (e.g. a MacBook Pro **M1**), you should download the Apple Silicon installer. It installs a version of OpenRocket that is optimized for the Apple Silicon processor and will run much faster. If you have an **Intel** processor, you should download the Intel installer. 

*NOTE: these instructions and screenshots are for macOS Ventura, but any other (recent) macOS version should behave similarly.*

### Installing the 22.02 Release
First, the .dmg installer file must be mounted. To do this, locate the downloaded file in Finder and double-click it or right-click it and select 'Open'. This will mount the image and pop up a window with the drag-and-drop installation window. Then follow the instructions below.

  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>
      <td>
       After mounting the installation disk, you will be greeted with this window. To install OpenRocket just simply drag and drop the 'OpenRocket' app on the left to the Applications folder on the right.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</html>

### First Launch of OpenRocket

Upon opening the OpenRocket application for the first time, you will get a security warning. The OpenRocket app is code-signed and is safe to install, but Apple still gives a small warning. To get rid of this warning, just click 'Open' and you will be greeted with the OpenRocket splash screen.
